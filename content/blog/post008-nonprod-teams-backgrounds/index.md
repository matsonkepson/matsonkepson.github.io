## Something Funny Today

---

Recently, I found myself in some truly dreary work meetings. The topics were heavy, the mood was grim, and I thought, **why not spice things up a little?** The idea of customizing my Teams background to lighten the atmosphere.

It seemed like a brilliant plan(at least to me). However not everyone appreciated it, of course (some people take life way too seriously)... But hey, it brought a smile to a few faces, and that’s what bounds people together, right?

If you’re stuck in a similar situation, why not give it a try? A little humor can go a long way in turning a dull meeting into something sparkling :tada:
